# Homophily-among-Football-Players

The English premier league is arguably the biggest league in the world in which the player transfers are vital to a club’s success both on and off the pitch. These long-term investments are often investigated and signed off on by the managers of the clubs and can either make or break a club.
This project aims at analyzing the presence of homophily in transfer decisions where managers may develop preferences towards certain players. These will be evaluated on the success of the signing and the success of the manager. In order to fathom this phenomenon, we will be taking a player’s fee as his expected performance and minutes played as his actual performance. Furthermore, we will be taking a manager’s average points per game as his performance indicator. 

# Homophily---------->Choice---------->Performance
To detect homophily in the network, we computed and compared both observed and simulated values of the chance that managers choose players of the same nationality. Due to homophily, managers may buy more players of the same nationality than in a random scenario.
